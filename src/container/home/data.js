      "Grafting is a technique widely used worldwide to combat biotic and abiotic stresses. However, it is a relatively new concept in Pakistan and needs attention. A study was conducted with aim to investigate the impact of local (bottle gourd, pumpkin, vegetable marrow, sponge gourd termed as Desi) and exotic (Korean bottle guard and pumpkin lines 1391, 1392 and 1393 and 1395) rootstocks on growth, production and quality of watermelon scion (hybrid varieties Anarkali and Black Beauty). Self-grafted watermelon plants were utilized as control. Anarkali and Black Beauty grafted onto Desi bottle gourd rootstock showed higher grafting success percentage (89.8 % and 87.8%, respectively), particularly with Anarkali scion that showed grafting success in minimum duration, maximum chlorophyll content and early flower production compared with other grafting combinations. Anarkali and Black Beauty grafted onto Korean bottle gourd rootstock had maximum shoot diameter and highest number of shoots, respectively. Moreover, these plants also showed higher fruit weight and diameter compared with self-grafted plants. Sensory evaluation and quality analysis depicted highest quality of both varieties when grafted onto bottle gourd rootstock followed by self-grafted and Korean bottle gourd grafted plants. During 2nd year, values of almost all parameters including, vine length, length of lateral shoots, weight of largest and total fruit on vine, TSS and vitamin C, were highest for Anarkali grafted onto Desi bottle gourd compared to Self-grafted and pumpkin 1392 rootstock grafted plants. These findings showed Desi bottle gourd as the best rootstock for both watermelon varieties, particularly Anarkali.

      "Cotton has become less effective and consequently, farmers have started adopting sugarcane crops instead of cotton in the core cotton zone of Punjab province. We conducted this comprehensive study to extract the causes of cotton failure and postulate guidelines for the revival of cotton. We randomly selected 392 farmers from the district of Rahim Yar Khan who have partially or completely switched to sugarcane crops. Interviews with the farmers were conducted face to face after the formal verbal consent and ensuring the ethical guidelines. The comprehensive list of 68 constraints was solicited from the literature, field observation and experts’ opinions and later was approved by the Agricultural Officers of the study area. After pre test Cronbach alpha value of 0.862 ensured the reliability of the interview schedule. Principal Component Factor Analysis (PCA) and Biplot were applied to the data to extract key factors of cotton failure. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value of 0.646 allowed us to administer the PCA, which extracted a total of 7 factors including (i) climatic (ii) inputs related (iii) insect pests and diseases (iv) marketing (v) human (vi) financial and (vii) and institutional factors contributing in cotton failure. Climatic factors had the highest variance of 20.5% followed by inputs (17.8%), insect pests and diseases (15.6%), marketing (14.4%), human (12.4%), finance (11.1%) and institutional factors (7.9%). This implied that temperature, droughts and erratic rainfall were key factors whereas pertinent to the non-availability of resistant varieties and subdued seed quality farmers were unable to tackle climate-induced problems. More investment in research and development to produce climate-resistant, and insect-pests-resistant cotton varieties is recommended. Moreover, effective marketing opportunities and ensuring the support price are key enablers for cotton revival. ",

      "Efficacy of Biochar Developed from Different Feedstocks at Different Temperatures for Mitigating Root Knot Nematodes in Lycopersicon esculentum Mill",

    abstract: `Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) is a fundamental component of our diet, but it often faces a hidden problem in the soil, root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.). These tiny worms form galls on tomato roots leading to reduced yields and lower quality fruits. Usually, people use chemicals called nematicides to get rid of these worms but these chemicals can harm the environment and even make people sick. So, theres a need to find a better and more sustainable solution. Use biochar, a kind of charcoal made from natural materials which seems like a good way to control nematodes. This study focuses on how the temperature during biochar production (pyrolysis) affects its physical and morphological characteristics. Biochar was created from various sources (wheat straw, maize stalks, green waste and sugarcane bagasse) at different temperatures (300°C and 500°C). It was then tested at different concentrations (1%, 2% and 3% w/w) to combat root knot nematodes. These materials along with nematodes were used in a pot experiment with three repetitions in a randomly designed setup to see how effective they are in suppressing root-knot nematodes and promoting plant growth. Additionally, the study examined the physiochemical and elemental properties of these biochars along with their nematicidal activity in a controlled environment. The findings indicated that biochar extracts, when used in different concentrations did not exhibit direct nematicidal activity. Likewise, the application of biochar resulted in improved tomato plant growth and a decrease in root knot nematode development. According to the results, the most effective biochar treatment was sugarcane bagasse biochar produced at 300℃ followed by SCB500°C for both enhancing growth and managing nematodes in tomato. However, further investigation is needed to understand the specific mechanisms through which biochar application promotes growth and controls nematodes in tomato. Number of females, galls and egg masses were differed for all treatments. The lowest number of galls, egg masses and females were found in 3% sugarcane bagasse pyrolyzed at 300°C treatment and highest results were examined in the positive control. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to data regarding the nematode and plant growth parameters. The comparison of mean values was done by using the least significant difference Test (LSD). The results show that using biochar is important for managing root-knot nematodes (RKNs) in tomato and other crops.`,
